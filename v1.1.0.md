- service must have README with start instuctions, requirements etc.
- service must start on port 8080
- service should have Dockerfile

Allowed endpoints:
- /
- /up
- /down
- /sum

Allowed HTTP request methods:
- GET

If other request method is requested it should return error:
```
{
	"error":"request HTTP not allowed"
}
```
- with header *Content-Type: application/json*
- with proper http status code - 405

## Allowed endpoints:

### Request endpoint: '/'

#### Request method: GET

##### Logic: 
- root should return all possible endpoints

##### Response: 
- should be:

```
{
	"up":"/up",
	"down":"/down",
	"sum":"/sum",
}
```
- with header ***Content-Type: application/json***
- with proper http status code - 200


### Request endpoint: '/up'

#### Request method: GET

##### Requirements:
 - only receive number
 - only return number in response field *up*
 - only receive one number as query param in URI *?number=2*

##### Logic:

- if number is int it should return same number _( Status code: 200 )_
- if number is float, it should return rounded int _( Status code: 200 )_
- if not int or float requested it should return error _( Status code: 400 )_
- if more than one number is requested it should return error _( Status code: 406 )_
- if empty request return error _( Status code: 404 )_


##### Success response: 
- should be:

```
{
	"number":2,
	"up":2
}
```
- with header ***Content-Type: application/json***
- with proper http status code - *see Logic section ( Status code: xxx )*

##### Error response: 
- should be:
```
{
	"error":"some message"
}
```
- with header *Content-Type: application/json*
- with proper http status code - *see Logic section ( Status: xxx )*


###### Example request & response
- int
```
/up?number=1
```
```
{
	"number":1,
	"up":1
}
```
- float
```
/up?number=2.32
```
```
{
	"number":2.32,
	"up":3
}
```
- error
```
/up
```
```
{
	"error":"some message"
}
```


### Request endpoint: '/down'

#### Request method: GET

##### Requirements:
 - only receive number
 - only return number in response field *up*
 - only receive one number as query param in URI *?number=2*

##### Logic:

- if number is int it should return same number _( Status code: 200 )_
- if number is float, it should return rounded int _( Status code: 200 )_
- if not int or float requested it should return error _( Status code: 400 )_
- if more than one number is requested it should return error _( Status code: 406 )_
- if empty request return error _( Status code: 404 )_


##### Success response: 
- should be:

```
{
	"number":2,
	"up":2
}
```
- with header ***Content-Type: application/json***
- with proper http status code - *see Logic section ( Status code: xxx )*

##### Error response: 
- should be:
```
{
	"error":"some message"
}
```
- with header *Content-Type: application/json*
- with proper http status code - *see Logic section ( Status: xxx )*


###### Example request & response
- int
```
/up?number=1
```
```
{
	"number":1,
	"up":1
}
```
- float
```
/up?number=2.32
```
```
{
	"number":2.32,
	"up":2
}
```
- error
```
/up
```
```
{
	"error":"some message"
}
```


### Request endpoint: '/sum'

#### Request method: GET

##### Requirements:
 - receive more numbers & operator
 - return numbers array in response field *number*
 - receive multiple number as query param in URI *?number=2&number=3&number=4*
 - receive operator as query param in URI *?operator=minus*

##### Logic:

- check numbers and do requested operation  _( Status code: 200 )_
- possible operations:
	1. minus
	2. plus
	3. multiplication
- if not int or float requested it should return error _( Status code: 400 )_
- if one number is requested it should return error _( Status code: 406 )_
- if empty request return error _( Status code: 404 )_


##### Success response: 
- should be:

```
{
	"numbers":[2,2,3],
	"operator":"plus"
	"up":7
}
```
- with header ***Content-Type: application/json***
- with proper http status code - *see Logic section ( Status code: xxx )*

##### Error response: 
- should be:
```
{
	"error":"some message"
}
```
- with header *Content-Type: application/json*
- with proper http status code - *see Logic section ( Status: xxx )*


###### Example request & response
- int
```
/up?number=1&number=2&number=3&operator=minus
```
```
{
	"numbers":[1,2,3],
	"operator":"plus",
	"up":6
}
```
- error
```
/up
```
```
{
	"error":"some message"
}
```
